# Pitch Deck: Ad Genius

### **Slide 1: Title**

**Ad Genius**

*Turn product descriptions into revenue-generating ad campaigns in 60 seconds.*

### **Slide 2: The Problem**

**Creating great ad content is slow, expensive, and requires rare talent.**

-   **Time Sink:** SMB owners spend **5-10 hours per week** writing copy, finding images, and setting up campaigns. That's a full day of work lost.
-   **High Cost:** Hiring a freelance copywriter and designer costs **$500 - $2,000+ per campaign**. This is prohibitive for most small businesses.
-   **Inconsistent Results:** Without expertise, ad performance is a guessing game, leading to wasted ad spend and missed opportunities.

*Pain Math: A small e-commerce store running 4 campaigns/month could be spending $24,000/year on creative alone, or losing 240 hours of founder time.*

4.  The output is ready to be copied directly into an ad platform.

### **Slide 5: Why Now? The "Secret Sauce"**

**The convergence of multimodal AI and accessible APIs makes this uniquely possible.**

-   **Generative Models:** Recent advances (like Google's Gemini and Imagen) can now produce high-quality text and images that are commercially viable.
-   **Structured Output:** We can now reliably get structured data (JSON) back from LLMs, allowing us to build a real product, not just a text generator.
-   **API Economy:** We can build on top of world-class infrastructure without massive R&D overhead, allowing us to focus on the user experience and workflow.
