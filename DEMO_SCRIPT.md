**[0:00 - 0:30] The Problem & The Old Way**

"Good morning. Every e-commerce founder faces the same bottleneck: creating compelling ads. It's a painful process. You have to write headlines, body copy, find a good image... it can take hours, or cost thousands to hire a freelancer."

"For example, let's say we want to sell this **Aura Smart Mug**. The old way would involve opening a blank document, brainstorming, searching stock photo sites... it's slow and frustrating."

**(Point to the product description on the screen)**

"But what if we could do it all in 30 seconds?"

---

**[0:30 - 1:30] The "Wow" Moment**

"This is Ad Genius. We start with the same information every store owner already has: a simple product name and description."

**(Ensure the "Aura Smart Mug" sample is loaded.)**

"Now, watch this. I'm going to click one button: **'Generate Ad Content'**."

**(Click the button. The app goes into its loading state.)**

"Right now, our AI is doing two things. First, it's analyzing the product and writing three distinct versions of ad copy, optimized for engagement. Second, it's creating a detailed prompt for an image generator to create a unique, professional lifestyle photo. This isn't a stock photo; it's being generated from scratch, right now."

**(Wait for the results to load. It should be ~20-30 seconds. Use this time to build anticipation.)**

"And... here we go."

**[1:30 - 2:30] The Result & The Value**

**(The results are now on screen. Point to the different elements.)**

"In less than 30 seconds, we have a complete ad package."

"First, look at this image. It's not just a picture of the mug; it's a *lifestyle*. It's on a clean desk, there's a notebook... it tells a story. This is the kind of image that stops the scroll."

"Next, the copy. We have three different angles here.
- (Point to the first one) This one focuses on the core benefit: 'Never Drink Lukewarm Coffee Again'.
- (Point to the second) This one highlights the tech aspect: 'Smart, Sleek, and Perfectly Hot'.
- All with clear calls to action like 'Shop Now'."

"From a blank page to a launch-ready campaign in half a minute. This is a 95% reduction in time and effort."

**[2:30 - 3:00] The Metrics & The Edge Case**

"We're not just building a toy. We're building a reliable tool. We track key metrics for every single run."

**(Scroll down to the Metrics Panel.)**

"You can see the exact latency, an estimated cost—which is less than two cents—and a quality score to ensure the output is valid. This proves the POC is viable and cost-effective."

"And it's resilient. What if the input is bad?"

**(Quickly select the "Vague Product" from the dropdown.)**

"Even with a terrible description like 'a thing that does stuff', the model still produces coherent, albeit generic, results. This shows the system doesn't just break; it gracefully handles poor input, which is critical for a real-world product."

**(End of Demo)**

"This is the core of Ad Genius. We give small businesses the creative power of a major agency, for a fraction of the cost and time. Thank you."
